**This repo contains a js file that has two algorithmic functions within**

- distinctSum()
- dot_product();

### distinctSum(array1, array2)
This function accepts two arrays and returns the sum of numbers that only occur in one array.


### dot_product(vector1, vector2)
This function accepts two vectors, checks if they are of the same dimensions and computes the scalar product of both vectors.
In the case where the scalar product of the vectors is zero, the vectors are said to be orthogonal and are returned as such.
